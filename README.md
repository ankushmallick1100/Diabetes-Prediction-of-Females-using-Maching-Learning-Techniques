# Diabetes prediction using Maching Learning
# Description
This is a machine learning project that uses various machine learning algorithms to predict whether a patient is diabetic or not. Here I am using variour machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines(SVM), Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN), Logistic Regression, Logisitic Regression with Cross Validation(CV), Naive Bias, and XGBoost Classifier. I have wrtten a paper in this topic please check it out. The link of the paper is given below.
