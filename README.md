# Diabetes prediction using Maching Learning
This is a machine learning project that uses various machine learning alogorithms to predict whether a patient is diabetic or not. Here I am using variour machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines(SVM), Random Forest, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbours, Logistic Regression and Logisitic Regression with Cross Validation
*Support Vector Machine(SVM) gives the best accuracy*
